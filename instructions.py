Title: [Game Name]

Objective:
Your goal is to defeat all enemies in each level by accurately shooting projectiles at them.
There are 10 levels in the game, and you must unlock and complete each level to progress.
Earn level points and super level points by completing levels, and use them to buy upgrades.

Gameplay Instructions:

Starting the Game:
Upon starting the game, you will begin with the first level. To unlock and progress to the next level, you must successfully complete the current level.

Game Levels:
There are a total of 10 levels, each presenting different challenges with varying enemy placements and obstacles.
You must complete each level in sequential order, unlocking the next level as you successfully finish the previous one.

Aiming and Shooting:
To aim your shot, move your mouse to adjust the direction.
A partial display of the projectile's trajectory will be shown as you move your mouse, helping you aim.
Click the mouse button to release the projectile and fire your shot.

Defeating Enemies:
Your objective is to eliminate all enemies on the screen by hitting them accurately with your projectiles.
Be precise in your shots, as you have a limited number of projectiles for each level.

Earning Points:
Completing a level will earn you level points and super level points.
Level points are used to purchase basic upgrades and power-ups.
Super level points are rarer and can be used to unlock special abilities and advanced upgrades (which are not available in your game).

Upgrades:
Visit the "Upgrade" screen between levels to spend your level points and super level points.
Upgrades may include increasing your projectile's power, accuracy, or adding special effects (even though you mentioned no special abilities).
As you progress, you'll unlock more powerful upgrades, but they'll also cost more.

Retry and Restart:
If you fail a level, you can retry it as many times as needed to complete it.
If you want to restart the entire game, there should be an option to do so in the main menu.

Winning the Game:
To win the game, successfully complete all 10 levels.
Once you've beaten the final level, you'll be declared the winner!

Saving Progress:
Some games offer a save feature so you can continue your progress later. Ensure your players can save their progress if they exit the game and return later.

Additional Tips:
Take your time to aim accurately before shooting.
Consider the physics of the game, such as gravity, when aiming for distant enemies.
Upgrade your projectile's power and upgrade your character to make later levels more manageable.
Enjoy the game and have fun improving your shooting skills!"""
